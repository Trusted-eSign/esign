    Paragraf_3_2: "In the title bar of the application there is a button for calling the side menu (the menu is shown in the figure to the right) and a button for switching the interface language. Using the application menu, you navigate to the main wizards and you can additionally access the page containing information about the program, the license installation wizard, and quick reference help.",
    Paragraf_3_3: "The main application window has a fixed size without the possibility of changing it. The application saves all global settings that were made by the user. Saving occurs when the application is closed. In the process of working with the application, the user's actions are also saved, executed by him in the wizards (selection of certificates, selection of files, etc.). When you go to another wizard (application page) and return to the application, you do not have to perform the same operations again.",
    Header4: "2. MASTER OF LICENSE INSTALLATION",
    Paragraf_4_1: "For the correct operation of the application, you must install a license for this software product. If, at the application startup, there are pop-up messages about the absence of a license expired in the license period, the impossibility of reading the license file, this indicates that the application will not correctly perform the operations of signing and decrypting files. The presence of a valid license for the application should be given special attention.",
    Paragraf_4_2: "To install the license and get information about it in the application there is a special wizard (shown in the figure below), which allows you to install a license from a file or clipboard. In either case, the license depends on the license.lic file and places it in the user's directory.",
    Paragraf_4_3a: "After the license has been successfully installed, the program must be restarted. If you receive messages like the following when entering a license for a software product: a non-correct license key, the license is not suitable for this program, the license has expired, then contact the technical support of the developer company (",
    Paragraf_4_3b: ").",
    Header5: "3. MASTER OF CREATION / ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE CHECKS",
    Paragraf_5_1: "In the Trusted eSign application, there is a wizard in which the operations for creating an electronic signature for one or multiple files are performed. In the same wizard, you perform the operations for creating a file signature and checking signed files. The wizard page is shown in the figure below.",
    Paragraf_5_2: "The wizard page is divided into three areas. On the left is the selection area of the subscriber certificate. The certificate is selected from the dialog with the display of certificates from the repositories.",
    Paragraf_5_3: "In the dialog for selecting a subscriber certificate, only certificates from the Personal Certificates section that have a private key binding are displayed. Other certificates are not displayed and are not available for use in this wizard.",
    Paragraf_5_4: "To verify the signature, it is enough to select the files to be scanned - files with the extension .sig, which contain an electronic signature and click on the Check button. No additional manipulation is necessary when verifying the signature.",
    Paragraf_5_5: "If the source file is not found automatically when checking the signature file separated from the signature file, its selection will be offered. The result of checking signatures is displayed as a message.",
    Paragraf_5_6: "To view the files before creating a signature, you can use the context menu (see the figure below). The signature is checked for the selected files. The figure shows the result of checking the signature of one of the files. Additionally, you can remove the signature from the signed files. In this case, the original file is saved, and the signature is deleted.",
    Header6: "4. MASTER OF ENCRYPTION / DISCRIPTION OF FILES",
    Paragraf_6_1: "In the application Trusted eSign there is a wizard in which the operations of encryption and decryption of files are performed. To perform the encryption operation, the recipients of encrypted files are used as a list of certificates. Those users of the application who have a private key associated with one of the recipient certificates will be able to decrypt the files.",
    Paragraf_6_2: "The Encryption / Decryption Wizard is shown in the figure below. The wizard page is divided into three areas: on the left is the selection area of the recipient certificates, below are the settings for performing the operations and on the right is the selection area of the source files and the result display.",
    Paragraf_6_3: "When selecting the mode of deleting files after encryption, pay attention to providing access to encrypted files. To do this, you can add a personal certificate to the list of recipients, linked to a private key.",
    Paragraf_6_4: "The figure at the right shows the dialog for selecting recipient certificates. The list of available certificates displays all certificates from the connected stores. The certificates are grouped by tabs. In the dialog, a certificate search operation is available.",
    Paragraf_6_5: "In the wizard, you can modify the list of recipients and files by adding them. The encryption operation is performed only on a set of selected files. To view files before encryption, you can use the context menu (see the figure below).",
    Paragraf_6_6: "Decrypt files by clicking the Decrypt button. To successfully perform the operation, one of the connected storages must contain a private key that is linked to the recipient's certificate. Otherwise an error will be issued.",
    Paragraf_6_7: "If the files are successfully decrypted, the result is displayed in the same wizard and the files themselves are saved either next to the encrypted files or in the specified directory.",
    Header7: "5. MASTER OF CERTIFICATES MANAGEMENT AND KEYS",
    Paragraf_7_1: "To manage certificates and keys, a separate wizard has been added to the application. The wizard page displays tabs with certificates grouped into them. When you first start the application, you must have a test certificate and a key attached to it in the Personal Certificates tab.",
    Paragraf_7_2: "In order to import the new certificate into the repository, you can use the context menu - select the Import Certificate operation. In the dialog box that appears, select the certificate (BASE64 and DER encodings are supported) and the certificate is placed in the repository. ",
    Paragraf_7_3: "Import of certificates from the repositories of supported providers is carried out at the level of using additional utilities. The most common situations are explained in the User's Guide.",
